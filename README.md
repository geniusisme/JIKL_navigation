# JIKL_navigation
Use Alt + letter keys for keyboard naviagtion, keeping your fingers on asdf jkl; position.


# Description

This is *.apk script which helps with keyboard navigation. It works everywhere, as opposed to specialized text editors, and uses convenient key scheme:

* alt + j - move cursor left
* alt + i - move cursor up
* alt + k - move cursor down
* alt + l - move cursor right
* alt + u - move to home ( start of the line )
* alt + o - move to end ( end of the line )
* alt + h - delete last character ( backspace )
* alt + ; - delete next character ( delete )
* alt + p - move page up
* alt + / - move page down

Script also contains shortcuts for modifiers, for example shift + alt + j is the same thing as shift + left, which is standard for selecting text as moving left.


The idea is nothing new, but has surprisingly low coverage in community. I use this scheme for 5 years now and only heard of other people using it twice.
